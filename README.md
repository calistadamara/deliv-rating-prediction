## Business Understanding
### 📜 Project Background
[Data](
In this project, I chose the Delivery Operations topic because based on Statista Market Analyst, this business experiences rapid growth every year and is predicted to experience greater growth in 2025-2026. In Indonesia itself, it has experienced 30% growth, especially after the pandemic. This business also affects various sectors, such as economic growth, social behavior, and digitalization.<br >
### 📜 Problem
The large growth of this business also makes its competitiveness high, so the problem raised in this project is the high competition in the delivery business.
### 📜 Goals
1. Analyzing Customer Behaviours on Delivery Operation Services and found features that influence the Rating Rate
2. Create a predictive model that can accurately predict the Rating Rate
### 📜 Business Objective
Increase the Rating rate by 30% within 3 months by creating a predictive model on the Rating Rate and optimizing features that influence it. 

## Data Description
The dataset used is an open source [Zomato Delivery Operations Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/zomato-delivery-operations-analytics-dataset).
